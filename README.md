# ElectricFieldGame
A pygame-based game where the player can place stationary charges to move a "puck" with a positive charge. The aim of the game is to use the stationary charges to maneuver the puck to the goal indicated by a checkered flag.

The game has three levels not including the starting area. The starting area provides a sandbox for players to experiment with the way the puck moves in response to point charges. The three levels can be accessed by the corresponding buttons along the top of the game window. 

This game is dependent on the Pygame package to run, so it must be installed before playing. The game should be formatted in the same way as this repository, with the two Python scripts in the root directory alongside a directory called "dependencies" containing all the images necessary to run the game.
